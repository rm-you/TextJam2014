VYou are part of the maintenance crew aboard the //LGDE Heroism//, a colony ship bound for the 1212 Antilae system. Your team is responsible for bootstrapping the colony while the majority of the colonists stay in hibernation.\u000a\u000aSomething has gone incredibly wrong. When you awoke, the ship was not in the 1212 Antilae system, but orbiting a mysterious planet in an unknown binary star system. By some stroke of luck, the planet appears to be habitable. You finish with stasis recovery protocol in time to hear the news: the captain has given the order to begin colonization. Given the ship's limited fuel reserves and malfunctioning navigation system, he had no choice.\u000a\u000aYou stumble out of the recovery ward and into the maintenance lockers, where Captain Scott is giving a speech to the bustling crew. Some stand at attention, though the majority purposefully gather their gear and prepare to head to the planet.\u000a\u000a[[Listen to the captain's speech.|StartSlow]]\u000a\u000a[[Suit up.|StartFast]]

VThe pod launches <<if visited("Delay Pod")>>jerkily<<else>>gracefully<<endif>> from the Heroism, spinning around and giving you a clear view of the large blue planet you are about to descend towards. Autopilot thrusters press you into your seat, an uncomfortable reminder of the G-forces normally associated with atmospheric entry.\u000a\u000aYou squawk on the radio to the Heroism, //"Pod 126BB-M beginning  descent."//\u000a\u000aThe reinforced viewport starts to flare up as the pod rushes through atmosphere. The computer automatically closes the window, leaving you with only your instruments and trust in the autopilot. An eternity passes as the pod is endlessly jostled by atmospheric turbulence. Airfoils deploy and thrusters fire, and you feel the pod decelerating, the instruments showing the colony fast approaching. The landing goes like clockwork, with a gentle thud as the pod touches the ground and tips over.\u000a\u000aYou toggle the radio as it links in with the local Colony grid, //"Pod 126BB-M has landed safely. Getting out now."//\u000a\u000a[[Open the pod and step outside.|Hub]]

VA fearsome beast lurks here, with a tough exoskeleton and sharp fangs protruding from its maw. It paces back and forth on its four legs and looks aggressive. <<if $plasma_torch is 0>>\u000a\u000aWithout a weapon it's best not to pick a fight with it. If your plasma torch had more power you could use it to fight.<<endif>>
